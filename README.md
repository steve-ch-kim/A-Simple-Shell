# A-Simple-Shell

 A shell is a program which allows a user to send commands to the operang system (OS), and allows the 
 OS to respond to the user by prinng output to the screen. The shell allows a simple character-oriented 
 interface in which the user types a string of characters (terminated by pressing Enter(\n)) and the OS 
 responds by prinng lines of characters back to the screen.
